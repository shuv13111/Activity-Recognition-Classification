# Activity-Recognition-Classification

Activity Recognition using AREM Dataset with Ensemble Methods
Overview
This project focuses on classifying human activities using the AREM dataset. We employ various ensemble methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification.

Dataset
The AREM dataset contains data from wearable sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes. The dataset captures the movements of individuals performing different activities such as walking, running, sitting, and standing.

Features
Data preprocessing and normalization.
Feature extraction from raw sensor data.
Implementation of various ensemble methods.
Model evaluation and comparison.
Ensemble Methods Used
Bagging with Decision Trees
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
Stacking with diverse base classifiers
Requirements
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
