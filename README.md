Overview:
This project focuses on classifying human activities using the AREM dataset. We employ various ensemble methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification.

Dataset:
The AREM dataset contains data from wearable sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes. The dataset captures the movements of individuals performing different activities such as walking, running, sitting, and standing.

Features:
Data preprocessing and normalization.
Feature extraction from raw sensor data.
Implementation of various ensemble methods.
Model evaluation and comparison.

Ensemble Methods Used:
Bagging with Decision Trees
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
Stacking with diverse base classifiers

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
